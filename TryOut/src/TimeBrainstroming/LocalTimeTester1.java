			Exercise :- 
						Thomas has to board train departing at 8:00 PM, You have to check whether he will be able to board or not.
						It takes him 2.5 hrs to reach the station and further 15 mins to reach the platform.
						Before what time should he leave his house in order to board the train ?
						(Hint :- You can use isAfter() and isBefore() methods, take reference from LocalDate tryout)
